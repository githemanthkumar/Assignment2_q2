Input and Kernel Definition:

A 5x5 input matrix is manually defined with values ranging from 1 to 25.
A 3x3 Laplacian kernel (edge detection filter) is defined. This kernel highlights areas with significant changes in intensity, useful for detecting edges in images.
Reshaping Input:

The input matrix is reshaped from a 2D array (5x5) into a 4D array (1, 5, 5, 1), which is the expected format for TensorFlow's convolution operations.
The shape is (batch_size, height, width, channels) where batch_size is 1, height and width are 5, and channels is 1 (grayscale image).
Convolution Layer Setup:

A simple Sequential model is used with a Conv2D layer. The Conv2D layer takes the kernel size (3x3), the stride, and the padding type as parameters.
The kernel weights are set manually using the set_weights() method, which allows us to apply the predefined Laplacian kernel.
Stride and Padding Variations:

The convolution is performed with four combinations of stride and padding:
Stride = 1, Padding = 'VALID': No padding, output is smaller.
Stride = 1, Padding = 'SAME': Padding is applied to keep output size the same as input.
Stride = 2, Padding = 'VALID': Larger stride results in downsampling.
Stride = 2, Padding = 'SAME': Padding is applied, but output is downsampled due to stride.
Feature Map Output:

The output feature maps from each convolution operation are printed, showing the effects of each stride and padding configuration.
The feature maps highlight how the kernel detects edges in the input matrix depending on the stride and padding used.
Key Concepts:

Stride affects how much the kernel moves across the input, controlling the output size.
Padding ensures the output size is either reduced ('VALID') or preserved ('SAME').
The kernel itself is applied to detect edges, emphasizing changes in pixel values in the input.
This process is a fundamental operation in image processing and deep learning, where convolutional layers help in feature extraction.
